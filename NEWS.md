# squat (development version)

# squat 0.4.0

## New features

* Adaptation to new API of fdacluster.
* Added rotation invariant elastic distance.
* Added no alignment option in distance matrix computation via SRVF.
* Added roll-pitch-yaw representation.
* Added `format()`/`print()` pair correctly.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Remove dependency to **purrr** in favor of base R `*apply()` family to reduce
dependency trail.
* Replace **furrr** with **future.apply** for consistency with the removal of
**purrr**.
* Update roxygen version.
* Fix bug in predict from PCA with new data. Properly compute L2 inner product.
* Fix bug in predict from prcomp object.

# squat 0.3.0

## New features

* Added `S3` specialization of the `stats::predict()` function for `prcomp_qts` 
objects.
* Added function `qts2aats()` which allows to switch from quaternion to 
axis-angle representation of rotations.
* Added usual operations `+`, `-`, `*` and `inverse_qts()` for quaternion time 
series using the [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) 
library.

## Small improvements

* Make sure quaternion geodesic mean is not flipped.
* Fix issues in PCA:
  - avoid numerical overflows due to bad choice of `k` in `gam()`;
  - improved documentation;
  - Use same number of basis functions in uni- and multivariate decompositions.
* Updated GHA scripts and `README`.
* Fix bug related to Rcpp following RcppCore/Rcpp#1287.

# squat 0.2.1

* Add `use_fence` robustification option;
* Adapt to changes in [**fdacluster**](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/index.html);
* Properly compute tangent spaces along mean QTS;
* Update *News* section of website.

# squat 0.2.0

Major features:

* Added hierarichal clustering;
* Added DBSCAN clustering;
* Added distance matrix computation.

Minor improvements:

* Adapted code to match new API in [**fdacluster**](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/index.html) package.

# squat 0.1.0

## Major statistical features
* A first API proposal with a class `qts` and a class `qts_sample` for which a
number of methods are properly implemented.
* Available statistical methods for QTS samples: 
  * random generation according to the Gaussian functional model via
  [`rnorm_qts()`](https://lmjl-alea.github.io/squat/reference/rnorm_qts.html),
  * [`scale()`](https://lmjl-alea.github.io/squat/reference/scale.html), 
  * [`mean()`](https://lmjl-alea.github.io/squat/reference/mean.qts_sample.html), 
  * [`median()`](https://lmjl-alea.github.io/squat/reference/median.qts_sample.html),
  * distance matrix computation via [`distDTW()`](https://lmjl-alea.github.io/squat/reference/distDTW.html) (i.e. for now we use the dynamic time warping),
  * tangent principal component analysis via [`prcomp()`](https://lmjl-alea.github.io/squat/reference/prcomp.qts_sample.html),
  * k-means with optional alignment via [`kmeans()`](https://lmjl-alea.github.io/squat/reference/kmeans.html).
* Added multiple ways of displaying samples of QTS.
* Added two example datasets.

## Improvements
* Make all functions applicable to a single QTS also applicable to QTS samples,
with appropriate class for the output.
* Enable `as_qts_sample()` to generate a QTS sample of size 1 from a single QTS
as input argument.
* Rename `change_points` argument to the `plot.qts()` function to better reflect
its flexibility.
* Added subset operator for QTS sample objects.
* Added `append` S3 method for QTS sample objects.
* Added `hemispherize()` function to remove any discontinuities in QTS due to
quaternion flips.
* Any parallelization computation is now handled using the
[**futureverse**](https://www.futureverse.org) principles and, in particular,
implemented through the use of the [**furrr**](https://furrr.futureverse.org)
package.

# squat 0.0.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Initial version.
